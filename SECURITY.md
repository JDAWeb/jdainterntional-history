- No user accounts, logins, forms, cookies, or databases
- No server-side code or third-party scripts

### Security status
There are **no known vulnerabilities**.  
Because the site is 100 % static and contains only publicly released documents, it presents no security risk to visitors.

### Reporting a concern
Even though this is a read-only archive, we still welcome reports.

If you discover anything that appears to be:
- Private/personal information accidentally published
- Malicious content
- A broken link that should be fixed
