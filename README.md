Welcome to the official public archive of **Joint Development Associates International**, a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in Grand Junction, Colorado by Bob Hedlund.

For over three decades we partnered with communities in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan to provide clean water, sustainable agriculture, education, health training, and hope — touching tens of thousands of lives.

After completing our final projects and successfully evacuating and resettling hundreds of Afghan colleagues and their families in 2021–2023, JDA officially closed in 2025.

This website and repository preserve that full story forever.
